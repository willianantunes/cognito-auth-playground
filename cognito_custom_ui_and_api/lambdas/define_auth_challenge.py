# The DefineAuthChallenge Lambda trigger takes as input a session array of previous challenges and responses.
# It then outputs the next challenge name and Booleans that indicate whether the user is authenticated (and should be granted tokens) or not.
# This Lambda trigger is a state machine that controls the userâ€™s path through the challenges.
